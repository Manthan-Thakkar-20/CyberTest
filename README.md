# CyberTest
## Frontend
## Backend
When testing using the test_....py files:
- Please cd to backend and use the pytest command from terminal instead of VSCode's sidebar testing thing!!!
- Also if you want to test submit answers or all of them at once change the "15" on test_prep_quiz.py line 13 and quiz_handler.py lines 23 and 28 to "3".
